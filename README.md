- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SundayLee109 (just call me Sunday)
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in playing tetris game.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying in senior high school.
- I'm Z rank(actually around U(Z rank means unranked) on Tetr.io (24083TR)), and I could got X, but my internet here is too bad to play Tetra league.
- I'm Taiwanese, so can talk to me in both Chinese and English, but my English is pretty bad(Last time test I got 58), so less use some word that I don't know.
- Use language:C++,Java(just start to learn it)
